#### User Stories
- As a user, I want to recieve a "hand" of white cards (10) on game initiation because I need funny white cards to consider.
- As a user, I want one user to serve as a "round leader" in each round.
- As a user, if I am not round leader, I want to be a "player" in the round.
- As a round leader, I want to be served a "black card" in a round.
- As a round player, I want to compare my hand against the leader's black card and select one card for consideration by the round leader.  
- As a user, I want access to a game state screen which provides information on the current round, including user scores, who is a leader and who is a player, and who has and hasn't chosen cards for the round.
As a user, I want to the round to conclude after the round leader selects his or her favorite user card. 
As a user, I want to see a round recap screen which includes all submitted cards.
